DATA.zip contains two folders: NYLON and CNTF.

NYLON folder contains FITTING and EXPERIMENT_MODEL subfolders.

  A. FITTING includes tsv files from testing machine and a Matlab script for their interpretation (output is a figure and polynomial coefficients printed on the screen).
  
  B. EXPERIMENT_MODEL includes xlsx files collecting data from tests on twisted nylon fibers and a Matlab script for their interpretation (output is a figure).

CNTF folder contains CROSS_SECTION, FITTING and EXPERIMENT_MODEL subfolders.

  A. CROSS_SECTION includes a Matlab script to plot the theoretical cross-section of the fiber, made of fibrils (output is a figure).
  
  B. FITTING includes txt files from testing machine and a Matlab script for their interpretation (output is a figure and the "pol.mat" file, collecting polynomial coefficients).
  
  C. EXPERIMENT_MODEL includes xlsx files collecting data from tests on twisted CNTF fibers, the pol file (see previous point) and two Matlab script.
  
      C1. Script_CNTF_EXPERIMENTS plots the experimental results (output is a figure).
      
      C2. Script_CNTF_MODEL compares the theoretical model with experimental results (output is a figure).
